# CARLA-PID-Controller
We design a PID controller to steer an CARLA-simulated autonomous car on a pre-determined racetrack. We use MATLAB, Simulink, and MATLAB’s System Identification Toolbox to model the car into a suitable transfer function then design a PID controller using Simulink’s Control System Toolbox that meets acceptable specifications on both the transfer function and the CARLA simulator.
